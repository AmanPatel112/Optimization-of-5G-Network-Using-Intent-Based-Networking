## Introduction.
The automatic control over the network platform is an admired requirement of the network operators. The Fifth generation network provides a wide range of services with high bandwidth, greater reliability, excellent performance, and latency. The 5G technology can be optimized by Intent-Based networking, IBN supports network orchestration, automatic provision, the configuration of the servers, allocations of the resources, rerouting the path. I tend to propose the Intent-Based networking model with its flow according to the stages. Additionally, I  will also talk about how IBN tools are the key factor for network slicing to provide higher-level network configuration. Secondly, I have proposed the GAN algorithm for network optimization and predicting dynamic traffic and resource allocation. To verify the modelâ€™s effectiveness I will conduct the evaluation from the datasets to check network systems and applications scenarios adding that I will employ LTSM to classify new evolving features of a dynamic network.  
## Motivation
The traditional operation and maintenance management methods are characterized by high labor cost, error probability, backward hauling, and network maintenance methods, and low management efficiency becomes difficult for the Network operators (NOs). To cater to this problem, the network itself should be smart enough to resolve the problem very efficiently. The optimization of the 5G network can be achieved by Intent-based Networking. With the introduction of intent-based networking, the new network can cope with the dynamic and ever-changing demand of the network. The management of the network would be efficient using Intent-Based Networking as it can is to reduce manual administration such as changing configurations, reducing traffic, resource allocation, and implementing security controls.

## Dataset.
To evaluate the effectiveness and the accuracy of the model I have considered the dataset from the crawdad with the number of nodes, number of timeslices, and the maximum number of traffic. 1https://crawdad.org/ucsb/meshnet/20070201/
