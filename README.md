## Introduction.
The automatic control over the network platform is an admired requirement of the network operators. The Fifth generation network provides a wide range of services with high bandwidth, greater reliability, excellent performance, and latency. The 5G technology can be optimized by Intent-Based networking, IBN supports network orchestration, automatic provision, the configuration of the servers, allocations of the resources, rerouting the path. I tend to propose the Intent-Based networking model with its flow according to the stages. Additionally, I  will also talk about how IBN tools are the key factor for network slicing to provide higher-level network configuration. Secondly, I have proposed the GAN algorithm for network optimization and predicting dynamic traffic and resource allocation. To verify the modelâ€™s effectiveness I will conduct the evaluation from the datasets to check network systems and applications scenarios adding that I will employ LTSM to classify new evolving features of a dynamic network.
